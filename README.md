## Overview

After considering the opening of a shop in Oahu called Surf n' Shake, we have decided that we will need investor backing to accompany our savings so this idea can become a reality.  We have held a successful first meeting with a potential investor, W. Avy.  W. Avy has some concerns about the impacts of weather on the shop remaining open for business, and we have been tasked with analyzing weather data he has collected to help determine how feasible running this shop is.  We are specifically going to compare temperatures for the months of June and December to see if this store can remain open all year round.

## Results

- The average temperature for the month of December was 71.
- The highest temperature for December was 83.
- The lowest temperature for December was 56.

### Overall Results

- There is a difference of 4 degrees between the averages of temperatures in June and December.
- There is a difference of 2 degrees between the max temperatures in June and December.
- There is a difference of 8 degrees between the min temperatures in June and December.

## Summary

Based on the results of temperature analysis for the months of June and December, it seems that the temperatures year-round are pretty stable and will yield more predictable sales.

Two additional queries:

1) Despite the fact that temperatures are similar throughout the year, our investor's previous project did not prove to be sustainable due to rain.  It would be a good idea to take rain's impact on the store into consideration as well to see how the sales of ice cream would be affected due to an assumed reduction in traffic.

2) It might also be a good idea to see how ice cream sales alone are affected based on temperatures.  How do cooler temperatures impact ice cream sales?  Will these impacts cause us to consider boosting the surfing side of the business or other incentives?
