## Overview

After considering the opening of a shop in Oahu called Surf n' Shake, we have decided that we will need investor backing to accompany our savings so this idea can become a reality.  We have held a successful first meeting with a potential investor, W. Avy.  W. Avy has some concerns about the impacts of weather on the shop remaining open for business, and we have been tasked with analyzing weather data he has collected to help determine how feasible running this shop is.  We are specifically going to compare temperatures for the months of June and December to see if this store can remain open all year round.
